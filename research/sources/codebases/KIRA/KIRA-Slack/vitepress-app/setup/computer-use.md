# Computer Use

KIRA can automatically control web browsers using Playwright.

## 📋 Overview

When Computer Use is enabled:
- Automatic website login
- Auto-fill web forms
- Data scraping
- Web UI automated testing
- Complex web task automation

---

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Launch KIRA App
Open the Environment Variables tab.

### 2. Find Computer Use Section
Scroll to **Computer Use** section

### 3. Enable Chrome
- Turn the **Chrome** toggle switch **ON**

::: tip Using Chrome Profile
When Chrome toggle is on, Playwright uses Chrome profile.
You can reuse already logged-in sessions without logging in each time.
:::

### 4. Visible Browser (Optional)
- Turn **"Visible browser"** toggle **ON** if you want Playwright automation to run in a real Chrome window
- With this option on:
  - Browser actions are visible on your desktop
  - The desktop app manages a standalone Playwright MCP server
  - Existing Chrome profile state is still reused

### 5. Save Settings
- Click **"Save Settings"** button

### 6. Server Start and Initial Setup

When you click **"Start"** button:

1. If **Visible browser** is enabled, Chrome opens as part of browser automation
2. **Manually log in** to required websites (e.g., company SSO, Gmail, etc.)
3. Login info is saved to Chrome profile
4. **Close the browser**
5. The engine reuses the saved profile on future runs

::: warning Initial Setup Required
Use **Open Profile Setup** before browser tasks to log in with the same Chrome profile.
Once logged in, login state persists automatically.

## 💡 Chrome Profile Benefits

### Advantages of Using Profile
1. **Session persistence**: Log in once, stays logged in
2. **Cookie reuse**: Uses previous session info
3. **Extensions**: Can use installed Chrome extensions
4. **Settings preserved**: Uses browser settings as-is

### Login Session Persistence
Login info from initial server start is saved to Chrome profile:
- Auto-maintains login state on next server start
- No re-login needed when using Computer Use
- Cookies and session info auto-preserved

### Visible Browser
When this option is on:
- **Browser actions are visible while Playwright runs**
- Useful for debugging and watching what the agent is doing
- Can make browser automation feel slower or more intrusive than background mode

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Chrome Won't Open
- Verify Chrome browser is installed
  - **macOS**: Check Chrome in Applications folder
  - **Windows**: Check Chrome in Program Files or via Start menu search
- Check if other Chrome processes are running

### "Timeout" Error
- Check network connection
- Website may take long to load
- Verify page actually exists

### Login Not Persisting
- Verify CHROME_ENABLED is on
- Check if Chrome profile was created properly
- Verify website doesn't block cookies

### "Element not found" Error
- Website structure may have changed
- Provide more specific description to KIRA
- Example: "The login button is in the top right of the page"

---

## ⚠️ Cautions

### Security
- Don't write sensitive info (passwords, etc.) directly in Slack
- Send via DM or store in environment variables
- Login info is stored in Chrome profile

### Performance
- Browser automation takes time
- Complex tasks may take 1-2 minutes
- Please be patient

### Limitations
- Sites with CAPTCHA are difficult to automate
- Some websites may block automation
- May be limited by anti-bot systems

### Legal Considerations
- Check website terms of service
- Don't use on sites that prohibit automation
- Recommended for personal use only

## 💡 Tips

### Effective Requests
✅ **Be specific**:
```
"The login button on example.com is in the top right.
The ID input field is labeled 'email'."
```

❌ **Too vague**:
```
"Log in"
```

### Break Complex Tasks into Steps
```
1. "Go to example.com"
2. "Go to login page"
3. "Enter ID user@email.com"
4. "Enter password"
5. "Click login button"
```

### Reset Profile
If Chrome profile has issues:
1. Stop KIRA server
2. Delete Chrome profile folder
3. Restart server
4. Log in again
