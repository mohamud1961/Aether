## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Storage Locations

All KIRA data is stored on your local computer.

**App Settings:**
```
~/.kira/
├── config.env          # Environment variable settings file
└── server.log          # Server log file
```

**Data and Memory:**

Memory and databases are stored in the location set by the `FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR` environment variable.

- **Default**: `~/Documents/KIRA/`
- **Custom**: Can be changed in environment variable settings

```
{FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR}/
├── db/                # Database files
│   ├── waiting_answer.db  # Waiting answer DB
│   ├── confirm.db         # Pending approval DB
│   ├── email_tasks.db     # Email tasks DB
│   └── jira_tasks.db      # Jira tasks DB
└── memories/          # Memory (conversation history)
    ├── channels/      # Conversations by channel
    ├── projects/      # Project information
    ├── users/         # User information
    ├── decisions/     # Decisions
    └── index.md       # Auto-generated index
```

::: tip Changing Data Storage Location
Go to KIRA app > Environment Variables > Enter desired path in `FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR`.
Example: `/Users/yourname/Dropbox/KIRA` (sync with Dropbox)
:::

### Authentication Protection
- All API keys and tokens are stored unencrypted in `config.env`
- File permissions are set so only the current user can read
- Never share the config file

### External Communications
KIRA only communicates with:
- Anthropic API (Claude)
- Enabled MCP servers (Slack, Outlook, Perplexity, etc.)
