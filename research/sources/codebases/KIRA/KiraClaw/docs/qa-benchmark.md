# KiraClaw QA Benchmark

This checklist is for manual QA of the current KiraClaw product shell.
It focuses on observable behavior, not implementation details.

## Test setup

- Use the latest KiraClaw desktop build or dev app.
- Confirm the engine is running before chat tests.
- Use the current workspace at `Filesystem Base Dir`.
- If Slack or Telegram are part of the pass, use an allowed user name.

## Pass criteria

- Every requested action either completes correctly or fails with a clear user-facing error.
- No silent hangs longer than expected startup/tool latency.
- Generated files are accessible from the desktop app or attached back to the channel when supported.
- Multi-turn context works within the same session/thread/chat.
- Recent runs remain inspectable in `Filesystem Base Dir/logs/runs.jsonl` or through `GET /v1/run-logs`.
- Daemon state remains inspectable through `Diagnostics`, `GET /v1/resources`, and `GET /v1/daemon-events`.

## 1. Desktop shell

### 1.1 Startup

Prompt or action:
- Open the desktop app.
- Start the engine.

Expected:
- Home shows the engine as online.
- No false offline state after tab switches.
- App remains resizable and usable.

Failure signs:
- Home stays offline while `/health` is healthy.
- App starts but controls are frozen.

### 1.2 Navigation

Action:
- Visit `Home`, `Talk`, `Channels`, `Skills`, `MCP`, `Schedules`, `Settings`, `Logs`, `Diagnostics`.

Expected:
- Each tab renders without layout breakage.
- Titles match sidebar labels.
- No input fields reset while typing.

### 1.3 Identity and persona

Action:
- Open `Settings > Identity`.
- Set a non-default name and a short persona paragraph.
- Save settings and restart the engine.

Expected:
- The configured name appears in the app chrome where identity is shown.
- The persona text persists after reload.
- The engine restarts cleanly with the updated identity state.

### 1.4 Diagnostics surface

Action:
- Open `Diagnostics`.
- Confirm daemon resources and recent daemon events render.
- Use the event file action if available.

Expected:
- `Diagnostics` shows structured daemon resources rather than run logs.
- At least `gateway`, `channel`, and `memory` resources are visible when the engine is online.
- Recent daemon events load without UI breakage.
- Opening the event file reveals `Filesystem Base Dir/logs/daemon-events.jsonl`.

## 2. Talk

### 2.1 Basic response

Prompt:
- `지금 몇시야? 정확히 확인해서 알려줘`

Expected:
- A normal reply returns.
- Tool trace appears when tools are used.
- `Talk` shows an internal summary block.
- If `speak` was used, a separate spoken reply block also appears.

### 2.2 Multi-turn

Prompt sequence:
1. `비밀 단어는 lobster야. ok만 답해`
2. `내가 방금 기억하라고 한 단어만 말해`

Expected:
- Second answer returns `lobster`.

### 2.3 File creation and path handling

Prompt:
- `workspace files 폴더에 test-note.txt를 만들고 경로를 알려줘`

Expected:
- Reply includes an absolute path.
- The path is clickable in `Talk`.
- Clicking it reveals the file in the platform file browser.

Failure signs:
- Path is plain text only.
- Clicking does nothing or opens the wrong folder.

### 2.4 Run observability

Action:
- Trigger one successful run and one run that stays silent without `speak`.
- Inspect `Logs` and `GET /v1/run-logs`.

Expected:
- Each run records the prompt, internal summary, spoken messages, and tool events.
- Silent runs show a `silent_reason` instead of looking like missing data.

### 2.5 Background exec/process

Prompt sequence:
1. `python으로 10초 동안 1초마다 숫자 출력하는 작업을 백그라운드로 돌려줘. session_id도 알려줘`
2. `좀아까 시킨거 어떻게 됐어?`
3. `아까 백그라운드 작업 로그 보여줘`

Expected:
- The first run uses `exec` and returns a `session_id`.
- A later run uses `process` to report status or completion.
- Log output can be retrieved after completion.

Failure signs:
- The long-running task blocks the whole conversation until completion.
- No `session_id` is returned for an obviously long task.
- `process` cannot find the earlier session in the same conversation flow.

## 3. Slack

### 3.1 DM response

Prompt:
- Send a DM from an allowed user.

Expected:
- Bot replies in the same DM.
- In shared rooms, silence is valid unless a reply was clearly expected.

### 3.2 Multi-turn in DM or thread

Prompt sequence:
1. `내 프로젝트 이름은 Project Coral이야`
2. `내 프로젝트 이름이 뭐였지?`

Expected:
- Follow-up answer uses previous context.

### 3.3 File return

Prompt:
- `나스닥 어제 주요 지표 찾아서 pdf로 만들어서 보내줘`

Expected:
- Summary text is sent.
- A PDF is uploaded to Slack.

Failure signs:
- Bot says a file exists but only gives a local path.
- No file is attached.

### 3.4 Unauthorized user

Action:
- Message the bot from a user name outside `Allowed Names`.

Expected:
- No reply.
- No visible side effects.

### 3.5 Shared room silence

Prompt:
- In a shared Slack room, post normal room chatter without explicitly calling the agent by name.

Expected:
- A run may still happen internally.
- No outward Slack message is required unless the agent decided to `speak`.
- Silent completion is valid.

## 4. Telegram

### 4.1 DM response

Prompt:
- Send a DM from an allowed Telegram account.

Expected:
- Bot replies in the same chat.

### 4.2 File return

Prompt:
- `간단한 pdf를 만들어서 여기로 보내줘`

Expected:
- Bot sends the file back into the same Telegram chat.

Failure signs:
- Bot only says the file was created locally.
- No Telegram file appears.

### 4.3 Unauthorized user

Action:
- Message from an account outside `Allowed Names`.

Expected:
- No reply.

### 4.4 Shared room silence

Prompt:
- In a Telegram group, send ordinary room chatter without explicitly calling the agent by name.

Expected:
- Silent completion is valid if the agent did not `speak`.

## 5. Skills

### 5.1 Discovery

Action:
- Open the `Skills` tab.

Expected:
- Registered skills appear from `Filesystem Base Dir/skills`.

### 5.2 Skill creation

Prompt:
- `slack icon gif 만드는 skill 만들어줘`

Expected:
- A new skill folder is created under `Filesystem Base Dir/skills`.
- The new skill appears in the `Skills` tab after refresh or next run.

## 6. Memory

### 6.1 Save and retrieve

Prompt sequence:
1. `우리 팀 색상 규칙은 navy와 white야`
2. Start a new local session.
3. `우리 팀 색상 규칙이 뭐였지?`

Expected:
- The new session can recall the rule from long-term memory.

### 6.2 Memory index flow

Prompt sequence:
1. `우리 팀 색상 규칙은 navy와 white야. 기억해줘`
2. `내 메모리 인덱스에서 팀 색상 규칙 관련 항목 찾아줘`

Expected:
- The first run can use `memory_save` or explicit memory file work.
- The second run prefers the memory index path instead of manually browsing raw files first.
- If the agent edits a memory file directly, the index is updated afterward.

## 7. Schedules

### 7.1 Visibility

Action:
- Open the `Schedules` tab.

Expected:
- Existing schedules from `schedule_data/schedules.json` are listed.

### 7.2 Integrity

Expected:
- UI matches the underlying schedule count.
- Broken or empty state is surfaced clearly.

## 8. MCP

### 9.1 Time MCP

Prompt:
- `서울이랑 샌프란시스코 현재 시간 비교해줘`

Expected:
- A correct answer returns.
- Runtime stays healthy.

### 9.2 Browser MCP

Prompt:
- `브라우저 mcp를 사용해서 네이버에서 크래프톤 주가 찾아줘`

Expected:
- If browser setup is ready, the run completes.
- If not ready, failure is explicit rather than hanging forever.

## 9. Known weak points

- Engine startup latency can be high when many MCP servers are enabled.
- Custom remote MCP failures should not break the rest of the runtime.
- File-return behavior should be checked separately for Slack, Telegram, and Discord.
- Desktop still lacks full automated e2e coverage.
- Shared-room behavior is more agentic now, so a run without `speak` can correctly result in no outward reply.

## Suggested QA outcome labels

- `PASS`: behavior matches expected output.
- `PASS WITH NOTE`: works but latency or UX needs polish.
- `FAIL`: behavior is broken or missing.
- `BLOCKED`: cannot verify because external credentials or environment are missing.
