Local desktop AI Coworker runtime for KIRA.

KiraClaw is the successor product line to `KIRA-Slack`. It keeps the local desktop product shape, but rebuilds the runtime around a lighter core and a clearer agent model:

- adapters are the outside ears and mouth
- the core agent thinks, plans, and chooses tools
- `speak` is the explicit outward speech action
- `internal_summary` is the internal run summary for QA and diagnostics
- memory has both implicit runtime behavior and explicit index tools

`KIRA-Slack` is now the legacy product line used only for bridge migration and auto-update replacement. New runtime work happens in `KiraClaw`.

KiraClaw is a fresh start inspired in part by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw): a local AI Coworker should stay practical, explicit, and easy to operate without turning into a giant platform.

## What Is KiraClaw?

KiraClaw is a local AI agent runtime that combines:

- a lightweight core engine
- a small local gateway around that engine
- a desktop control plane for setup, runs, logs, and status
- channel adapters for Slack, Telegram, and Discord
- local memory, skills, schedules, and run logs

It is closer to a practical local AI Coworker runtime than to a chat wrapper or a large orchestration platform.

The design goal is small and explicit:

- a lightweight core engine should stay easy to reason about
- channels should behave like adapters, not separate agent silos
- outward speech should be explicit through `speak`
- memory should stay local, file-backed, and indexable
- schedules should extend the same runtime instead of introducing a second automation system
- logs should make runs observable without turning the product into a heavyweight control center

You can start with either Claude or OpenAI by adding an API key in the desktop app, then configure other providers later if you need them.

---

## Why It Exists

`KIRA-Slack` proved the product shell:

- desktop packaging
- local settings
- update flow
- channel integrations
- local data handling

KiraClaw starts from a lightweight core engine and wraps it with a practical desktop harness. The point is not to add complexity for its own sake, but to keep a few strong concepts intact:

- one core runtime shared across Talk, channels, schedules, and logs
- explicit speech instead of forcing every run to become a reply
- local memory and skills that remain inspectable as files
- a desktop surface that makes the runtime understandable without hiding it

That keeps the product simple, but still leaves room for stronger agent ideas like diagnostics, pairing, or long-running process control.

---

## Current Product Shape

### Core surfaces

- `Talk`: direct local chat against the same daemon
- `Channels`: Slack, Telegram, and Discord on the same runtime
- `Skills`: workspace skills loaded from `Filesystem Base Dir/skills`
- `Schedules`: time-based automation runs that can deliver back into Talk or external channels
- `Logs`: recent live and completed run logs, internal summaries, spoken replies, and tool usage

### Current runtime rules

- shared rooms are treated as ambient spaces, not strict one-user request channels
- grouped room messages are passed in as room transcripts
- outward speech in channels should happen through `speak`
- silent completion is valid for schedules and shared-room runs
- run-level observability is persisted to `Filesystem Base Dir/logs/runs.jsonl`

### Legacy compatibility

The daemon still supports bridge-mode compatibility with existing `KIRA-Slack` installs:

- `KIRACLAW_HOME_MODE=auto` prefers `~/.kira` before `~/.kiraclaw`
- legacy `~/.kira/config.env` is used to backfill tokens and workspace settings
- legacy `~/.kira/credential.json` is reused for Vertex AI when needed

See [migration-from-kira-slack.md](docs/migration-from-kira-slack.md).

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- `uv`

Optional:

- Anthropic or OpenAI API key
- Slack app credentials
- Telegram bot token
- Discord bot token
- Vertex credentials if you want that provider

### Run the daemon

```bash
cd KiraClaw
cp .env.example .env
uv run kiraclaw-agentd
```

Check health:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /v1/runtime`
- `GET /v1/sessions`
- `GET /v1/run-logs`
- `GET /v1/schedules`
- `GET /v1/skills`
- `POST /v1/runs`

### Run the desktop shell

```bash
cd KiraClaw/apps/desktop
npm install
npm start
```

The desktop app is the local control plane for:

- runtime status
- direct test runs
- identity and persona settings
- channel settings
- MCP settings
- skills and schedules visibility
- recent run logs

---

## Agentic Runtime Model

KiraClaw no longer assumes that every run must directly produce a user-facing answer.

### Runtime concepts

- `adapter`: receives external input and publishes external output
- `core agent`: thinks, decides, and uses tools
- `speak`: explicit outward speech
- `internal_summary`: internal run summary
- `memory index`: stable metadata for memory lookup and updates

The important part is the separation of concerns: the core engine stays small, while channels, memory, schedules, and desktop controls stay around it as a harness.

### Memory model

Memory now has two layers:

- implicit runtime retrieval/save for normal runs
- explicit tools for memory-aware work

The intended explicit flow is:

1. `memory_index_search`
2. read or edit the actual memory files
3. `memory_index_save`

That keeps the index stable while still letting the agent manipulate the underlying memory files.

### Channel behavior

- direct replies to the current conversation should use `speak`
- proactive delivery to another target should use explicit channel tools
- shared-room runs can remain silent if speaking is not useful

---

## Features

### Desktop

- local runtime control
- direct chat surface
- settings for identity, persona, channels, workspace, and MCP
- recent run logs with prompt, internal summary, spoken reply, and tool usage

### Channels

- Slack
- Telegram
- Discord

### Local agent substrate

- skills from `Filesystem Base Dir/skills`
- local memory store and index
- schedules for time-based automation
- persistent run logs

### Bridge release support

- keeps `KIRA` app identity for migration releases
- uses the existing update line for `KIRA-Slack -> KiraClaw`
- keeps the bridge-specific release checklist separate from the core runtime design

See [bridge-release-checklist.md](docs/bridge-release-checklist.md).

## Notes

- KiraClaw is the active runtime line.
- `KIRA-Slack` is now legacy and kept for bridge migration only.
- The current product shape is intentionally small: `Chat + Schedules + Local Control Plane`.
- The runtime should stay agentic without becoming structurally heavy.
