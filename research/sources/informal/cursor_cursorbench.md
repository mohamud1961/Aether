Blog / research Developers are asking coding agents to take on longer, more complex tasks that span multiple files,
tools, and steps. As these requests grow in scope, the evals that measure agent performance need to evolve with them. At
Cursor, we use a hybrid online-offline eval process to keep our understanding of model quality aligned with what
developers actually do. The offline part uses CursorBench, our internal eval suite based on real Cursor sessions from
our engineering team. Because tasks come from actual Cursor usage rather than public repositories, CursorBench is both
better at distinguishing between models and more aligned with real developer outcomes than public benchmarks. We built
CursorBench to measure multiple dimensions of agent performance including solution correctness, code quality,
efficiency, and interaction behavior. This blog focuses on solution correctness results, but in practice we evaluate
agents across all of these axes. This chart shows correctness scores on CursorBench plotted against median completion
tokens to capture the compute/latency tradeoff that affects usability. The top right corner represents ideal agent
quality, with highest performance at the lowest cost. We supplement CursorBench with controlled analysis on live
traffic. These online evals catch regressions that offline suites miss, like where the agent's output looks correct to a
grader but feels worse to a developer using the product. Together, this online-offline loop keeps our notion of model
quality grounded in production as workflows change, and lets us craft the best possible agent experience in Cursor. #
The limitations of public benchmarks A good benchmark needs to distinguish between models that perform differently in
practice, while aligning with how developers actually experience those models. Public offline evals struggle at both.
The first issue is alignment. As developers take on increasingly complex and varied work with agents, static or
misaligned benchmarks end up testing the wrong things entirely. Most SWE benchmarks, for example, are still focused on
bug-fixing tasks. Similarly, Terminal-Bench emphasizes broad puzzle-style tasks like finding the best chess move from a
board position. We find that these are not well aligned with the coding work developers ask agents to do. The second is
grading. Many public benchmark tasks assume a narrow set of correct solutions, but most developer requests are
underspecified enough to admit many valid approaches. As a result, benchmarks tend to either penalize alternative
correct approaches or append synthetic requirements to remove underspecification. Neither provides an accurate
assessment of true performance. The third is contamination. SWE-bench Verified, Pro, and Multilingual all draw tasks
from public repositories that end up in model training data, inflating scores. OpenAI
[recently](https://openai.com/index/why-we-no-longer-evaluate-swe-bench-verified/) stopped reporting SWE-bench Verified
results entirely after finding that frontier models could reproduce gold patches from memory, and that nearly 60% of
unsolved problems had flawed tests. The result is that at frontier levels, these benchmarks no longer tell apart models
that have very different utility for developers. # Building CursorBench We source tasks for CursorBench using [Cursor
Blame](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/cursor-blame) , which traces committed code back to the agent request that
produced it. This gives us a natural pairing of developer query and ground-truth solution. Many tasks come from our
internal codebase and controlled sources, which reduces the risk that models have seen them in training. We refresh the
suite every few months to track shifts in how developers use agents. Problem scope in our correctness evals has roughly
doubled from the initial version to the current one, CursorBench-3, in terms of both lines of code and mean number of
files. CursorBench-3 tasks involve substantially more lines than those in SWE-bench Verified, Pro, or Multilingual.
While lines of code is an imperfect measure of difficulty, growth on that metric reflects the way we've incorporated
more challenging tasks into CursorBench, such as handling multi-workspace environments with monorepos, investigating
production logs, and performing long-running experiments. CursorBench tasks also align with the underspecified, often
ambiguous way developers talk to agents. Our task descriptions are intentionally short, in contrast with the detailed
GitHub issues sourced in public benchmarks, and we use agentic graders to reliably score them. # CursorBench shows more
separation between models These differences in task complexity and specification have practical consequences for
benchmark utility. CursorBench produces more separation between models at frontier levels, where public benchmarks are
increasingly saturated, and in some cases, models like Haiku can match or exceed GPT-5. CursorBench distinguishes
reliably between models that developers experience as meaningfully different. # CursorBench scores align with online
evals Online evaluation measures whether improvements to our agent actually help developers in practice. We track a set
of high-level proxies of agent outcomes, including both interaction and output quality signals, and look for consistent
movement across them rather than optimizing for any single metric. Aggregating these allows us to catch regressions
where the agent's output scores well under an offline grader, but doesn't actually work well for developers. We use
controlled online experiments to attribute impact. For example, when iterating on [semantic search and
retrieval](https://cursor.com/blog/semsearch) , we ran an ablation removing the semantic search tool entirely. This let
us pinpoint scenarios where semantic search mattered most, such as repository-grounded question-answering on larger
codebases. CursorBench rankings also more closely track how developers experience model quality in Cursor, as measured
by our online evaluation metrics. # The next eval suite While CursorBench-3 tasks are longer than tasks on public
benchmarks, they still resolve within a single session. We anticipate that over the next year, the vast majority of
development work will shift to long-running agents working on their own computers, and we are planning to adapt
CursorBench accordingly. Doing so will require finding ways to make grading cheaper, solve reproducibility for tasks
that interact with external services, and close the gap between offline assessment and developer experience. The online-
offline loop gives us what we think is the right foundation, and we plan to share more as we build on it. If you're
