Blog / product Cursor's long-running agents research preview is now available at
[cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents) for all Ultra, Teams, and Enterprise users. The long-running agent is the
result of our research on agents working autonomously on more ambitious projects, including the work we shared last
month on [how Cursor built a web browser](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents) . During that experiment, we saw
frontier models fail in predictable ways on long-horizon tasks. We addressed these limitations by creating a custom
harness that enables agents to take on more difficult work and see it through to completion. We released a version of
this harness last week as part of a [research preview](https://cursor.com/blog/self-driving-codebases) . The results
show that long-running agents produced substantially larger PRs with merge rates comparable to other agents. Talking
with participants in our research preview, we heard that long-running agents successfully completed a range of tasks
that were previously out of reach for agents. A few example runs from the research preview include: Building an all-new
chat platform integrated with an existing open-source tool (runtime: 36 hours) Implementing a mobile app based on an
existing web app (runtime: 30 hours) Refactoring an authentication and RBAC system (runtime: 25 hours) # Making models
more capable Successfully completing difficult tasks requires frontier intelligence and the right harness. By working
with every frontier model and building a custom harness for each, we are in a unique position to build the best
scaffolding that leverages the strengths of different models. We found that there are a couple general principles that
help us achieve better performance. Planning before execution When iterating directly with a model, tight prompt-
response loops let you monitor the agent and nudge it back on course when needed. When the agent goes off and works on a
larger task autonomously, a slightly wrong assumption can turn into a completely incorrect solution by the end. Long-
running agents in Cursor propose a plan and wait for approval instead of immediately jumping into execution, recognizing
that upfront alignment reduces the need for follow-ups. Following through on tasks Frontier models can write great code,
but often forget the big picture of their task, lose track of what they're doing, or stop at partial completion. Long-
running agents use a plan and multiple different agents checking each other's work in order to follow through on larger,
more complex tasks. # Findings to date Initial participants in the research preview used long-running agents to
implement large features, refactor complex systems, fix challenging bugs, overhaul performance, and create high-coverage
tests. I shipped two architecture overhauls. It's an incredible tool for "I don't know if this is possible but I'm
curious to see" type work. I can run five in parallel, for everything from creating Mac window managers to stuffing CEF
into Tauri. Theo Browne CEO , T3 Chat Agents commonly ran for more than a day, producing PRs that merged with minimal
follow-up work. Users could step away, focus on other work, close their laptop, and come back to working solutions. I
planned for this project to take an entire quarter to accomplish. With Cursor long-running agents, that timeline
compressed to just a couple days. And I could do two or three additional projects. I can kick-off a 52-hour task that I
don't have to babysit and come back to a big PR with 151k lines of code. Zack Jackson Infra Architect , Rspack Compared
to synchronous agents, long-running agents were more thorough in their approach and wrote code that was more production-
ready. The magical part of the new harness is allowing the same model to make something production-ready. I tested the
same bug-fix prompt locally vs. with a long-running agent, both with Codex 5.3. The local agent fixed it fairly quickly,
but the long-running one went further to find edge cases, fix similar occurrences, and create high-coverage tests. Tejas
Haveri CTO , DevAccel-Labs # Using long-running agents at Cursor For the last month, we've been testing the limits of
long-running agents internally. We’ve used them for experiments to see how far we could push them, as well as for
production work on Cursor itself. Here are a few tasks we gave long-running agents that we have since merged. Video
renderer optimization We asked an agent to optimize a video renderer whose performance was bottlenecking deployment. It
completed a full migration to Rust and implemented custom kernels, reproducing identical visual output by working purely
from the original logic. Policy-driven network access for sandboxed code We needed JSON-driven network policy controls
and a local HTTP proxy for sandboxed processes. The proxy needed to be correct across protocols, enforce policy
consistently, and fail safely without allowing blocked traffic. The long-running agent created a ten-thousand line PR
that had very few issues when we ran a large test suite against it. Follow-up work consisted mainly of changes we didn't
specify in our initial request. Sudo support in Cursor CLI Some tasks break CLI agents the moment they hit sudo,
especially tasks related to system administration or ops. We asked a long-running agent to implement secure sudo
password prompting, which required stitching together multiple subsystems and reasoning about Unix auth flows. It
produced a working implementation that Cursor CLI now uses. # Toward self-driving codebases Long-running agents in
Cursor are an early milestone on the path [toward self-driving codebases](https://cursor.com/blog/self-driving-
codebases) , where agents can handle more work with less human intervention. It's now possible to delegate larger tasks
and come back hours or days later to working solutions. We are working on improving collaboration across long-running
agents so they can break up bigger projects into parallel work streams and take on even more ambitious projects with
less human intervention. We’re also working to develop new tools to handle the volume of code now being generated. As
the cost of code generation continues to fall, we'll need new approaches to deploying that code to production safely.
